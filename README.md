# Data preprocessing
The raw input data consists of **vibration acceleration signals**. We do not apply any additional preprocessing steps such as denoising or normalization. 

- Each sample is extracted by segmenting the original signal into fixed-length windows.
- A **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** is applied to each segment during data loading, implemented in `load_data.py`.

This ensures that the entire pipeline is simple, reproducible, and focused on frequency-domain representations only.

#  Quick Start

We provide a sample dataset and a ready-to-run script so that users can quickly reproduce the results.

1. **Preparing data**
- Option 1: Use the dataset already included in the `./data/` folder (if you downloaded the full repository ZIP).
- Option 2: Download the data manually from: [ðŸ“¥ External download link](https://your-download-link.com)

2. **Place the dataset in the `./data/` directory** (create this folder if it doesn't exist).

3. **Clone this repository**
   
4. **Run the main file to start training and evaluation**
