# Data preprocessing
The raw input data consists of **vibration acceleration signals**. We do not apply any additional preprocessing steps such as denoising or normalization. 

- Each sample is extracted by segmenting the original signal into fixed-length windows.
- A **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** is applied to each segment during data loading, implemented in `load_data.py`.

This ensures that the entire pipeline is simple, reproducible, and focused on frequency-domain representations only.
